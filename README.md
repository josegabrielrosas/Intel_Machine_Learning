# Intel_Machine_Learning
This course provides an overview of machine learning fundamentals on modern IntelÂ® architecture. Topics covered include:  
<br>Reviewing the types of problems that can be solved 
<br>Understanding building blocks Learning the fundamentals of building models in machine learning
<br>Exploring key algorithms
<br><br>By the end of this course, students will have practical knowledge of:  
<br>Supervised learning algorithms 
<br>Key concepts like under- and over-fitting, regularization, and cross-validation 
<br>How to identify the type of problem to be solved, choose the right algorithm, tune parameters, and validate a model 
<br><br>The course is structured around 12 weeks of lectures and exercises. 
<br>Each week requires three hours to complete. The exercises are implemented in Python*, so familiarity with the language is encouraged (you can learn along the way).
